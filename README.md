## Project Title: Continuous Delivery of Flask Application on GCP
Link: https://noahgift.github.io/cloud-data-analysis-at-scale/projects.html#project-1

In this project I set up continuous delivery of a flask appliation on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The flask application hosts a web application and displays various content when the user navigate to URLs. Continuous delivery is set up using Google Cloud Build and is set to trigger for push to any branch on my GitHub repository. 

To begin with, I followed the video at this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TfWdOvQXwU&feature=youtu.be to set up a simple flask application and set up continuous delivery with Cloud Build. After verifying that everything works as expected I followed the instructions here (https://github.com/noahgift/gcp-hello-ml) to make the application more complex. Specifically, I added the used pandas, wikipedia, and Google NLP to enhance the application following the instructions provided.
